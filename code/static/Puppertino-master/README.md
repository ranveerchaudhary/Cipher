# Welcome to Puppertino V 1.0!

Hi! Welcome to **Puppertino!** Puppertino is a framework meant to mimic the look
of **macOS** and follow the **human guidelines**. Puppertino is a Framework
created to be lightweight, modular, and cool looking!

> **NOTE**: Puppertino does not include any responsive system, you must use
> Bootstrap, Flexbox Grid, Skeleton, or some other responsive Framework along
> with it.

## Lightweight

I'm focused on making Puppertino as Lightweight as possible, I want it to become
a big framework, but not at the cost of weight and performance. So to keep it
small, I won't be adding AnimateCSS, or any other framework (No matter how cool
it is) on top of Puppertino. And to make it more lightweight, I have implemented
my second point.

## Modular

I'm developing Puppertino to be used with only the components you need or to be
used as a complete framework. Choosing the components that you need may help you
throw some extra KB that you don't need in your website or app.

## Cool looking

This is the most important part of Puppertino! This also means that I can go out
of the main components of macOS and human guidelines in the future to add other
things that I think maybe necessary or great to have in the framework. In any
case, coolness, it's my main focus with Puppertino.

# Current Components

Puppertino currently includes:

- Buttons
- Switches
- Actions
- Form Elements (Inputs, select, form validation)
- Modals
- Icons
- Font Layout
- Segmented Controls
- Tabs
- Shadows
- NEW! Dark Mode
- Color Palette

Yeah... That's all. But no worries! I'm working on adding new components every day!

# Usage

You can use Puppertino in 3 ways (for now):

1. You can download the `newfull.css` file located in the `/dist/` directory.
   Download this if you are sure that you need at least half of the elements
   that are present in Puppertino.
2. Download every component CSS that you need from the `/dist/` folder. Such as
   buttons or form elements or other components. While it maybe tedious to
   download  them one by one, this can help you to save some KBs in your website. :)
3. ~~You can now download the SCSS version of Puppertino, also located in `/dist/`.~~ **(Deprecated)**
