<h3 id = "decipher">1. The Decipher *️⃣</h3>
<p><strong>Cipher</strong> is a cutting-edge password generator and vault, utilizing quantum mechanics to create truly random and robust passwords. Cipher also employs neural networks to analyze passwords and stores them with military-grade encryption for enhanced security.</p>

<h3 id = "history" >2. History :thought_balloon:</h3>
<p>
The project kicked off in 2019 as a fun way explore Python, driven by the motivation to tackle a prevalent issue many individuals were facing at the time. The widespread reliance on weak passwords, often a combination of easily guessable information such as pet names, birthdays, or nicknames, presented a glaring security vulnerability. Compounding the matter, users habitually employed these weak passwords across multiple services, as highlighted by the alarming statistics referenced in

In response to these challenges, Cipher emerged as a solution. The initial iteration, developed exclusively in Python, featured a user interface implemented using the Tkinter library. Despite the UI exuding a nostalgic Windows 95 aesthetic, Cipher defied Tkinter's constraints, achieving a modern appearance with the added flair of a dark mode ;). The password generation mechanism relied on the random library, a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG), offering a level of security that, although less robust than today's standards, was deemed acceptably secure.

Version 2 marked a significant evolution, introducing password analysis capabilities through a set of conditional statements. The vault, a new addition in this version, leveraged the hashlib library to implement the SHA-256 bit hash (Secure Hashing Algorithm) and HMAC. Notably, salting was implemented to fortify the system against password-hash dictionaries. Subsequent versions featured minor updates, culminating in the current Version 7, which represents the pinnacle of Cipher's capabilities, offering the most refined and secure features to date.
